# LAB REPORT 4

***Step 1: Log into ieng6***

// image here

Keys Pressed: ```<up> <enter>```

The ```ssh armathur@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` command was 1 up in my history, so I used the up arrow to access it. This command lets me SSH into the ieng6 remote server.

***Step 2: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account***

Keys Pressed: ```<Cmd + V> <enter>```

I had the command ```git clone https://github.com/arulster17/lab7.git``` copied on my clipboard, so I used my computer's paste function to input it into the command line. This command clones the code from the GitHub repository and adds the code to my file system.

***Step 3: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail***

Keys Pressed: ```cd <space> l <tab> <enter>, bash t <tab> <enter>```

When ```cd l``` is typed into the command line, pressing ```<tab>``` will make the command autocomplete to ```cd lab7/```, as ```lab7``` is the only thing that starts with ```l``` in the working directory, Similarly, upon typing ```bash t```, pressing ```<tab>``` will make the command autocomplete to ```bash test.sh```, as ```test.sh``` is the only thing that starts with ```t``` in the working directory. The ```cd lab7/``` command moves the working directory into the cloned folder to continue work. The ```bash test.sh``` command runs the testing script.

***Step 4: Edit the code file to fix the failing test***


***Step 5: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed***
***Step 6:Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account***
